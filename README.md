# Research Design in Data Science
Data science is an integrative field that involves using statistical and computational styles to extract perceptivity and knowledge from data.
Research design is used to plan and execute a study or investigation to gather, analyze and interpret data to answer a specific research question or hypothesis. Research design helps ensure the validity and reliability of the results and provides a roadmap for conducting the study efficiently and effectively.
A well-designed research design is essential for a successful data analysis. By following the research design steps, one can ensure that the research project is well-structured and the researcher is able to answer the research question in a comprehensive and meaningful way.

# Defining the Research Question/Problem 
The first step is to define the research question. The question should be clear, concise and the focus should be on the problem to be solved. It should be specific enough that you can collect the necessary data and analyze it to solve the problem. A good research question will guide the entire research process, from collecting data to presenting results.

# Determining the type of Study 
To answer the research question, you need to determine the type of study that is best suited. There are several types of studies including:

-> Experimental study - manipulating one or more independent variable (attribute of an individual) to observe their effect on the dependent variable.

-> Quasi-experimental study - the variables are not manipulated by the searcher but instead groups are formed based on pre-existing statistical factors.

-> Survey research study - collecting data from a sample of individuals using structured questionnaires.

-> Case study - an in depth examination of a single individual (single entity in a study), group, or event to better understand a complex phenomenon.

-> Observational study - observing and recording the behaviour or characteristics of a group of individuals without attempting to manipulate any variables.

-> Longitudinal study - collecting data from the same individuals over an extended period to track changes and patterns.

-> Cross-sectional study - collecting data from a sample of individuals at a single point in time to make reasoning about a larger data set.

-> Meta analysis - a statistical method that combines the results of multiple studies to provide a more robust and comprehensive estimate of the effect of an intervention.

The type of study you choose will depend on the research question, the type of data you have, and the resources available to you.
# Sample Selection
A sample is selected from the available data which will be used for study. A sample is a subset of the data set you are studying. The sample should be representative of the data set and it should be selected in a way to minimise bias. Different types of sampling techniques include Probabilistic sampling where each member of the data set has an equal chance of being selected as sample and Non-Probabilistic sampling where the selection of members is not based on chance as sample.


1) Probabilistic sampling :-

 Random Sampling- each member of the data set has an equal and independent chance of being selected.

 Systematic Sampling- selecting every nth element from the data set where n is determined by the size of the data set and desired sample.

	Stratified Sampling- dividing the data set into different subgroups based on some relevant characteristic and then selecting a random sample from each subgroup.

	Cluster Sampling- dividing the data set into clusters and then selecting a random sample of cluster and finally selecting all the elements in the selected clusters.

2) Non-Probabilistic sampling :-

	Multi-stage Sampling- involves several stages of sampling starting with a larger group and gradually reducing the size until the sample is obtained.

	Convenience Sampling- selecting the sample based on convenience i.e., individuals who are available and willing to participate in the study.

	Quota Sampling- dividing the data set into subgroups based on desired characteristic and the sample is filled by selecting participants (individuals who take part in the study) until the desired number of participants in each subgroup is reached. 

	Snowball Sampling- starts with a small number of participants who fits the desired criteria and then expands from initial participants by asking them about others who might also fit the criteria until the desired sample size is reached or no more eligible participants can be identified.

The type of sampling method choose will depend on the research question and the type of study you are conducting.
# Data Collection
After the sample selection, you need to collect the data. It involves implementing a data collection plan which is appropriate for research question and the type of study. The data collected should be accurate, reliable and relevant to the research question as the quality of the data will impact the validity of the research results.
# Analyzing Data 
This involves evaluating and interpreting the collected data to draw conclusions for the research study using statistical methods. It is a critical step in research design as it answers the research question and test the investigation. 
# Report Results
Finally, you need to report the results of your analysis. This involves presenting the results in a clear and concise manner using tables, graphs, doucuments and other visual aids to conclude the results. The results should be interpreted considering the research question and should be presented in a understandable way.
